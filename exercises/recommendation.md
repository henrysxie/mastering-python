Given a list of restaurants,

```python
["Laut", "Random String", "Chipotle", "Eataly", "Sophie's Cuban", "Chop't", "Potbelly's"]
```

1. Write a function that takes the list of restaurants, shuffles the list, and one by one pops out a restaurant as a recommendation.

2. Make it better by randomly recommend a restaurant from the list that has not been recommended in the last 4 tries

3. Encapsulate it all within a class. Have the __init__ method take the list of restaurants, and have a recommend method behave like #2.
